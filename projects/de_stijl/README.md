# De Stijl Artwork – p5.js

## Overview
This project recreates a minimalist artwork inspired by the De Stijl art movement using p5.js.

The artwork is generated using geometric shapes, bold lines, and structured composition.

---

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- p5.js
- HTML5 Canvas

---

## Concepts Practiced
- Canvas creation
- Coordinate positioning
- Stroke and fill control
- Geometric composition
- Structured visual layout

---

## How It Works
The sketch initializes a canvas and draws:
- A main circular frame
- Diagonal color bands
- Smaller geometric elements
- Structured line placements

All drawing is handled inside the `draw()` function using p5.js rendering functions.

## Learning Purpose
This project focuses on:
- Understanding coordinate systems
- Practicing visual abstraction
- Structuring drawing logic cleanly
- Organizing small projects professionally
